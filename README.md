#The project here is Matrix Chain Ordering Problem

#As we all know Matrix Multiplication is associative so we will have     several ways to multiply a set of matrices.

#The Aim of the project is to find the the most optimized way of parenthesing the matrices in order complete the mutiplication quickly.

#For solving this problem we have come with DynamicProgramming implementation.

#You can INPUT dimensions of matrices and OUTPUT will be the matrices arranged in parentheses in order to optimize the multiplication.
